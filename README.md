# Embedded-Systems-Labs
Lab code that was used to program an MSP430 board. The labs each contained their own goals and learning objectives.
## Lab 1 - Flashing LEDs
  Introduction to binary operations in an embedded environment. How to set, clear, and flip single bits of a byte of memory. Also an introduction to making readable and maintainable Embedded Code. Meaning avoiding using hexadecimal numbers directly and instead using "mask" for each value. Also how to send information to the various pins on a microcontroller
## Lab 2 - Push buttons
  If statements used with embedded systems. How to isolate and check a single bit and determine its value. As well as reading information from input devices on a microcontroller, without using interrupts.
## Lab 3 - Timers
  Configuring and using a timer on a microcontroller. As well as using the capture and compare registers on the Timer. Done without interrupts.
## Lab 4 - Interrupts
  Configuring the timer on a microcontroller to send interrupts. Using interrupts to generate delays between events as well.
## Lab 5 - LCD
  Using the LCD display on a microcontroller to display bit information. Creating a basic stopwatch.
## Lab 6 - Advanced Timers
  Generating a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) by using multiple timers set to different time values. As well as using multiple pin functions.
## Lab 7 - Concurrency
  Setting up Concurrency events in an embedded system.
